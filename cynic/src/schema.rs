//! Types for describing a GraphQL schema in Rust.
//!
//! The `use_schema` macro will mostly output types that make use of the
//! traits in this module to describe the schema.  The derives then combine
//! these types with the `QueryBuilder` type to enforce the restrictions
//! of the schema.
//!
//! Note that this module is mostly concerned with the marker types output
//! by `use_schema`, _not_ the actual types users work with.  The traits
//! will usually be implemented on marker types, the geneirc parameters will
//! usually be marker types and the associated types will also usually be
//! markers.
