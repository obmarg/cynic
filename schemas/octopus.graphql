A subclass of the Decimal type which can handle floating point values gracefully by
converting them to strings before trying to convert them to Decimals.

To see why this is valuable, consider the following python shell session where we construct
Decimal values from floats and strings in turn:

> initial_val = 20.6

> Decimal(initial_val)
  Decimal('20.60000000000000142108547152020037174224853515625')

> Decimal(str(initial_val))
  Decimal('20.6')


* NOTE ON EDGE CASES FOR HIGH PRECISION INPUTS *

Note that cpython itself only retains up to 17 digits of precision for a float, and
disregards the rest, so if your *input* is a really big float, then this won't do you much
good, because:

> str(float('1.11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111'))
  '1.1111111111111112'

- whereas

> str(Decimal('1.11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111'))
  '1.11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111'

But that's not really the problem this class is trying to help with. It's to help with what
look like 'simple' numbers (like 20.2), which end up being converted to very long ones with a
slightly different value when converted to a decimal.

  'street_name': 'Example', 'street_type': 'Street'}`. In
  many cases this will be blank; we only use this field for
  Krakens where we need to supply this level of granularity
  to some third-party service, like a bulk mail provider.
