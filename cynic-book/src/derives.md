# Deriving GraphQL Queries

Cynic has a few layers to it. The highest level of these is it's derives -
using these derives you can define GraphQL queries using structs and enums, and
have them type checked against the GraphQL schema itself.

There are a number of different derives which this section details:

- [Query Fragments](./derives/query_framents.html)
- [Enums](./derives/enums.html)
- [Scalars](./derives/scalars.html)
- [Query Arguments](./derives/query_arguments.html)
- [Inline Fragments](./derives/query_arguments.html)
