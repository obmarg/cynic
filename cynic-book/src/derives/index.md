# Deriving GraphQL Queries

Cynic has a few layers to it. The highest level of these is it's derives -
using these derives you can define GraphQL queries using structs and enums, and
have them type checked against the GraphQL schema itself.

There are a number of different derives which this section details:

- [Query Fragments](./query-fragments.html)
- [Enums](./enums.html)
- [Scalars](./scalars.html)
- [Query Arguments](./query-arguments.html)
- [Inline Fragments](./inline-fragments.html)
