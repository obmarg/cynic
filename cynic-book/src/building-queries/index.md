# Building Queries Manually

The previous section of the book showed how to use the various derive macros
cynic provides to build out GraphQL queries. If you've got a more complex use
case, these might not always provide the functonality you're looking for.
Cynic provides lower level functionality for building queries without these
derives, and that's what we'll go into in this chapter.

This chapter is for advanced users of cynic, or those who're curious about how
it works under the hood. If you're new to cynic or want the easiest path to
making queries you probably want to go back to the [Deriving GraphQL
Queries](../derives/index.html) section.
