### New Features

- Every selection set in `ExecutableDocument` now has a span.

## v0.8.1 - 2024-11-11

### New Features

- Added a span for directive arguments

## v0.8.0 - 2024-11-07

### Breaking Changes

- Lexing failures now include the token that failed to parse
- `Description::raw_str` has been renamed `raw_untrimmed_str` to make its
  purpose clearer.
- `StringLiteral::raw_str` has been renamed `raw_untrimmed_str` to make its
  purpose clearer.
- `Float`s are now correctly represented as f64 rather than f32
- `Value::as_f32` & `ConstValue::as_f32` are now `as_f64`

### New Features

- Added convenience functions to `SchemaDefintion` to get the individual
  definitions from within
- Added `get` function to `ConstList`, `List,`, `ConstObject` and `Object` to
  get the value of an item or field from the list or object
- `ConstList`, `List`, `ConstObject` and `Object` now implement `IntoIterator`,
  which is equivalent to calling `items` or `fields`

  value types.

### Bug Fixes

### Changes

- `Iter` types are now reexported in the `type_system` and `executable` modules
- `Value` & `ConstValue` are now reexported from the crate root.

## v0.7.1 - 2024-10-25

### Bug Fixes

- Added `InputValueDefinition::default_value_span` again ([#1077](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/1077))

## v0.7.0 - 2024-10-25

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `InputValueDefiniton::default_value_span` - you should now fetch the
  span from the `default_value` itself.
- `RootOperationTypeDefinition::span` now covers the entire root operation type
  definition. For the old spans, use `RootOperationTypeDefinition::named_type_span`.

### New Features

## v0.5.2 - 2024-09-25

### New Features

- `Description` is now Display
  ([#1044](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/1044))

### Bug Fixes

- `Iter::with_ids` now takes self by reference, which works better with
  `Iter` no longer being `Copy`
  ([#1045](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/1045))

## v0.5.1 - 2024-09-25

### Bug Fixes

- Added the `Description` convenience functions that were missed in v0.5.0
  ([#1041](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/1041))

## v0.5.0 - 2024-09-25

### Breaking Changes

- Integer values are now represented by `IntValue` rather than an i32.
  Although the GraphQl `Int` type is represented by `i32` this restriction is
  not specified for the grammar.
  ([#1037](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/1037))
- `Iter` is no longer `Copy` as this could cause subtle bugs. It remains
  `Clone` so you can use that if you need to.
  ([#1036](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/1036))
- `IdRange` now implements `IntoIterator` instead of directly implementing
  `Iterator`. ([#1036](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/1036))

### New Features

- Pretty printer can now optionally sort definitions & fields in its output
  ([#1038](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/1038))
- The type ystem AST now has spans in more places
  ([#998](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/998/files)).

## v0.4.3 - 2024-06-04

### Bug Fixes

  ([#978](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/978))

## v0.4.2 - 2024-06-04

### New Features

- Added `FragmentSpread::fragment` function that looks up the named fragment
  ([#976](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/976))

## v0.4.1 - 2024-05-31

### New Features

- Added `Value::variables_used` to find variables used in a value
  ([#963](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/963))

- Pretty printing has been moved behind a new feature flag `pretty`
- The names of the pretty printing functions have been updated with a `_pretty`
  prefix.

### New Features

- All of the readers in the executable module now impl Display, allowing you
  to use them with `print!` and friends. This is hidden behind the `print`
  feature. ([#962](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/962))
- All of the `Id` types now impl `Hash`, `PartialEq`, `Eq` & `Debug`
  ([#961](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/961))
- All of the readers now have an `id` function that allows you to retreive an
  `Id` for that reader. ([#959](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/959))
- `Iter` now exposes a function `ids` that allows you to retrieve the underlying
  `IdRange` ([#959](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/959))

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a lot of bad formatting in the pretty printing of schema documents
  ([#957](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/957))
- Pretty printing will now add whitespace between fields & arguments that have
  a docstring ([#954](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/954))

  `impl ExactSizedIterator` ([#945](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/945))
- All the readers now `impl Debug`
  ([#923](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/923))

### Bug Fixes

  ([#948](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/948))

  ([#947](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic/pull/947))
